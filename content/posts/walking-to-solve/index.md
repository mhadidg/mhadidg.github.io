Every time I struggle with a problem, I find myself taking a short walk, whether pacing inside the house or somewhere
outdoors. I never really knew why it helped. I just knew it did. As I start moving, my thoughts flow become much more
fluid. Focus is a bit easier. Feels like a slightly upgraded version of myself.

Many people already do this, intentionally or not. A while back, a colleague of mine told me about his "walking
protocol." I immediately realized I was actually following the same protocol. Funny how the brain sometimes builds its
own habits that we might not be even aware of.

Nietzsche once said:

> All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.

He used to walk for hours most days, often through forests and mountains, letting his mind and ideas move freely. Steve
Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are known for holding meetings while walking outdoors. Jobs even made [walking meetings] a
regular thing.

Walking seems to [rewire the brain for creativity]. Research shows that [movement enhances communication] between brain
regions related to memory, planning, and creativity. I believe that would translate to a better likelihood of coming up
with a novel idea, better plan, or smarter solution.

As I read these studies a couple of years ago, I decided to put more effort to make walking more of a regular thing.
Over time, my brain learned to associate walking with problem-solving. A kind of [habitual priming].

Now, even when Iâ€™m not particularly stuck, a quick walk often feels like the best way to think better. Or at least
differently.
