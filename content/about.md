I engineer software with a bias toward simplicity, reliability, and impact. True believer in open-source principles and
standards.

My career started in Android development, where I deliver a couple of freelance projects for clients. It wasn't a long
journey, but it was a great experience and a non-trivial exercise of my technical and soft skills.

Later, I joined *Earthlink*, where I worked on large-scale infrastructure and learned how to build systems that scale,
are reliable, and are easy to maintain.

At that time, I was already heavily-invested in reading books about building software right, books like *Clean Code*,
*The Pragmatic Programmer*, *Design Patterns*, *Building Microservices*,
and [many more](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/63237197?shelf=read).

A few years later, I joined [Automattic], the company behind *WordPress* and many other great products. A globally
distributed company with a strong engineering culture. I grew a lot there, collaborating with brilliant engineers
from all over the world.

And yet... I no longer work at Automattic.

I'm **looking for a backend or backend-leaning fullstack role**, ideally remote-first, async-friendly company building a
*great* product. I have strong experience with *TypeScript/Node.js*, *Ruby*, *Java*, and fair experience with *Python*.
I'm proactive, fast learner, and the type of engineer that makes a real impact on products. [Contact](/contact) for
résumé; I won't disappoint =)

Travel is my passion; I've been to +15 cities in many countries. Lived in *Istanbul* for over a year; also lived in
*Kuala Lumpur* for a while. I love to explore new countries, meet new people, and experience different cultures.

**[Reading books]** is my preferred way to learn big things, explore different sciences, and just expand my
forever-shallow comprehension of the world; some of my favorites:

- *Design Patterns* (Gang of Four book). A foundational guide to solving common software design problems through
  language-agnostic patterns.
- *Building Microservices*. A practical guide to building microservice architectures with real-world patterns and
  trade-offs.
- *Getting Things Done*. A system for clearing mental clutter, turning overwhelm into calm, methodical productivity.
- *The Psychology of Money*. Great lessons on how behavior, more than knowledge, drives financial success.
- *The Righteous Mind*. Explores how morality is shaped by intuition more than reason. Explains deeply why smart
  people disagree on politics and religion.
- *Nonviolent Communication*: A framework for speaking and listening with empathy. A guide to resolving conflict by
  identifying feelings and needs behind word.

**When I'm not working**, you'll probably find me doing one of these things:

- *Sightseeing* (when I'm traveling). I find pleasure in exploring museums, historical sites, natural wonders, among
  other places.
- *Hiking*. My favorite activity. The joy that comes from physical movement in nature is hard to replicate anywhere
  else. If you have *AllTrails* account, find me [here].
- *Reading*. Mostly through RSS feeds. I enjoy reading about many things, including (but not limited to) software
  engineering, psychology, and politics.
- *Watching TV shows*. Seen a ton of shows. An episode every day with *Meta Quest 3*. Some of my favorites: *Hunter x
  Hunter*, *The Last of Us*, and *Black Mirror*. (Funny enough, I even track latest *Sci-Fi* and *Action* TV shows
  with [RSSible])
- *Playing Warzone (COD)*. A great way to unwind after a long day.
