I engineer software with a bias toward simplicity, clarity, and elegance. Big fan of open-source principles and
standards.

My journey with coding started in college. I learned the basics there. Right after graduation, I picked up *Python* and
built a simple [Notepad]-like app. My very first "real-world" project. Incredible feeling to see my code turn into a GUI
app I could actually interact with.

Shortly after, I learned *Android* development. Applied the knowledge through a couple of freelance projects.

Then came an offer from *Earthlink*, the leading ISP in Iraq. A great place to boost my engineering skills, work on
real infrastructure, and learn to handle big scale.

A few years later, I joined [Automattic], the company behind [WordPress.com], [Tumblr], and many other great products.
A globally distributed company with a strong engineering culture.

I [no longer] work at Automattic. **I'm currently looking for a backend role**, ideally remote-first, async-friendly
company building a *great* product. If this sounds like you, please reach out =)

Travel is my passion. I've visited +15 cities. Lived in *Istanbul* for over a year. Also lived in *Kuala Lumpur* for a
while. I love to explore new countries, meet new people, and experience different cultures.

**I'm [in love with books]**. Some of my favorites:

- *Design Patterns* (Gang of Four book). A foundational guide to solving common software design problems through
  language-agnostic patterns.
- *Building Microservices*. A practical guide to building microservice architectures with real-world patterns and
  trade-offs.
- *Getting Things Done*. A system for clearing mental clutter, turning overwhelm into calm, methodical productivity.
- *The Psychology of Money*. Great lessons on how behavior, more than knowledge, drives financial success.
- *The Righteous Mind*. Explores how morality is shaped by intuition more than reason. Explains deeply why smart
  people disagree on politics and religion.

**When I'm not working**, you'll probably find me doing one of these things:

- *Sightseeing* (when I'm traveling). I find pleasure in exploring museums, historical sites, natural wonders, among
  other places.
- *Hiking*. My favorite activity. The joy that comes from physical movement in nature is hard to replicate anywhere
  else. If you have *AllTrails* account, find me [here].
- *Reading*. Mostly through RSS feeds. I enjoy reading about many things, including (but not limited to) software
  engineering, psychology, and politics.
- *Watching TV shows*. Seen a ton of shows. An episode every day with *Meta Quest 3*. Some of my favorites: *Hunter x
  Hunter*, *The Last of Us*, and *Black Mirror*. (Funny enough, I even track latest *Sci-Fi* and *Action* TV shows
  with [RSSible])
- *Playing Warzone (COD)*. A great way to unwind after a long day.
