I engineer software with a bias toward simplicity, clarify, and elegance. Big fan of open-source principles and
standards.

My journey with coding started in college. I learned the basics there. Post-graduation, I picked up *Python* and built a
simple [Notepad]-like app. My very first "real-world" app. Incredible feeling to eventually see my code turn into a GUI
app I can interact with. I don’t have the code anymore, but it was neat as I recall it.

Shortly after, I learned *Android* development. Applied the knowledge through a couple of freelance projects.

A year later, I joined **[Earthlink]**, the leading ISP in Iraq. A great place to boost my engineering skills, work on
real infrastructure, and learn to handle big scale. I worked on the workflow automation project as an **individual
contributor**, then promoted to **lead the engineering side** of the project.

A few years later, I joined **[Automattic]**, the company behind [WordPress.com], [Tumblr], and many other great
products. A globally distributed company with a strong engineering culture. I joined the [MailPoet] team as a **software
engineer**, part of [WooCommerce]. MailPoet handles millions of emails per day.

I no longer work at Automattic.

**Travel is my passion**. I've visited +15 cities. Lived in *Istanbul* for over a year. Also lived in *Kuala
Lumpur* for a while. I love to explore new countries, meet new people, and experience different cultures.

**I love to [read books]**. Some of my favorites:

- **Design Patterns** (Gang of Four book). A foundational guide to solving common software design problems through
  language-agnostic patterns.
- **Building Microservices**. A practical guide to building microservice architectures with real-world patterns and
  trade-offs.
- **Getting Things Done**. A system for clearing mental clutter, turning overwhelm into calm, methodical productivity.
- **The Psychology of Money**. Great lessons on how behavior, more than knowledge, drives financial success.
- **The Righteous Mind**. Explores how morality is shaped by intuition more than reason. Explains deeply why smart
  people disagree on politics and religion.

**When I’m not working**, you’ll probably find me doing one of these things:

- **Sightseeing** (when I'm traveling). I find pleasure in exploring museums, historical sites, natural wonders, among
  other places.
- **Hiking**. My favorite activity. The joy that comes from physical movement in nature is hard to replicate anywhere
  else. If you have *AllTrails* account, find me [here].
- **Reading**. Mostly through RSS feeds. I enjoy reading about many things, including (but not limited to)
  software engineering, psychology, and politics.
- **Watching TV shows**. Seen a ton of shows. An episode every day with *Meta Quest 3*. Some of
  my favorites: *Hunter x Hunter*, *The Last of Us*, and *Black Mirror*.
- **Playing Warzone (COD)**. A great way to unwind after a long day.
